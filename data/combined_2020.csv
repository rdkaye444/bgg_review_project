Once all players have arrived, the new caretakers are revealed, and players add up their scores. Passengers belonging to the caretaker family are worth more.

Each round consists of a day phase, where you assign your students to tasks about town, and a night phase, where you recruit new students and train with them in secret.&#10;&#10;The day phase works similarly to a traditional worker placement game. You'll assign groups of students to different locations, and take the action at that location to scale with the number of students you assign. Certain spaces will allow you to gather resources like food, tools, and coins. Other spaces will present opportunities for you to invest those resources back into your troubled community--either by rebuilding, or by helping families in need.&#10;&#10;At the end of the day phase, the students you assigned to different locations on the board will count towards your influence in the area. If you have the most influence in an area, you will recruit the students in that area's residence, and then the students you assigned to that area will replace them in that residence. All other players' students in that area return to their schools.&#10;&#10;Managing the flow of students you recruit is the key to Manchukuo's gameplay.
